Here is a quick quiz on some of what we've learned this week. It won't be graded :)
Can a dictionary contain other dictionaries?This question is required. *
Yes
No

That's correct!
A dictionary can contain other dictionaries.
We can even have a dictionary that contains lists, and a list that contains dictionaries.

Fill in the blank: "Someone wrote a version of a program that uses a list to compute the answer, and I wrote a version of the program that uses a dictionary to solve the answer. So, our programs use different ________."This question is required. *

A
file formats
B
data structures
C
data libraries
D
modules


Correct!
Choosing to use a dictionary instead of a list is a good example of what it means to choose a data structure.

When we run the line of code my_variable = "1.25", what is the type of my_variable?This question is required. *
A
int
B
float
C
str
D
number

The answer is "str".

This is a tricky one. If it were my_variable = 1.25, the answer would be float, it would be a floating point number. But because there are quotation marks, "1.25" is actually a string and just treated as text. Why does this difference matter? Writing + will add two floats, but if the inputs are strings, it will join two strings together.

Open up Python and try showing the results of 1.25 + 1.25, and then show the results of "1.25" + "1.25" - the results are different!
