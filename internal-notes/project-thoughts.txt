Don't add to the assessments document yet, we're still exploring this idea:
If they complete more than needed this will give them extra credit.

--------------------
weather example:
--------------------

requests is a lot better but urlopen is sufficient for this

This api is nice-no apikey needed, data has complex but not-too-complex structure... but 
https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/OKX/33,36/forecast/hourly, https://api.weather.gov/points/40.7484,-73.9856
Openweather has africa so it would be better, although it does need an api key. We can give those out to people though.

Even better is open meteo


--------------------
abandoned: ball object
--------------------
Ball object
Pre-written example: have a “ball” with a weight, x and y position.
Shows that each class instance has independent state. 
A method on it like print-current-position and a stubbed method like print-is-y-position-negative
Students implement stubbed method
Students add a new method like get-distance-from-origin
(could then have different gravity, motion simulators, etc)

--------------------
abandoned: shirt object
--------------------
Clothes store - simple read-from-inventory app
Little console app that asks user for a Brand name to search for
We provide a lot of the structure
A “Shirt” class that has properties color, pocketColor, material, size, and method getCost() which uses material/size and if color!=pocketcolor is more expensive
We don’t need a parent class
We get a data file from the warehouse with inventory.
Add __init__ for convenience
Student: Read JSON file from disk and make object instances
Could have a search to know how many women’s t-shirts of a Brand (typed by user) are in stock
And then use the method to show costs

Add to the clothes store
Add a new inherited class
Pre-written example: ItemInStore base class, then ArticleOfClothing class, Shirts subclass,  T-shirts and button-down shirts
One motivation: different properties - Size is common to all, on-sale is common to all, but sleeve length + pocket color is a shirt-specific property

--------------------
abandoned: weather oop project
--------------------
Go back to the weather api program and make it more OOP
Load it into objects
Weather data project (autogradable)
Each weather point has a display-as-celsius point
Display data converted to celsius
Write the data out to another data file in celsius
Parent class has virtual methods onStart() onDataPointSeen(lat, long, temperature) onComplete()
Students write a child class that implements dataPointSeen - gets coldest temperature.


--------------------
abandoned: weather oop datavis
--------------------
Go back to the weather exercise from week 1
(use a prebuilt schema by us)
Insert the results into sql records
Use matplotlib to draw data visualization of the temperature over time


-----------
out of scope
------------
other dunders
custom error types
An exercise taking a topic and making a new class hierarchy
sql
	Joins, index, transactions
	Selecting count(*) to get number of rows in the table
	Logic in sql, select tackles+shots+goals*4 as estimatedskill
And on the topic of apis, if time, POSTing to an api
Discuss relationships between objects when you persist state:
Classic example of a blog, authors, posts
Why is it better to have the post link to an author id instead of just having the author’s name right there?
So in a sense the use of json is like using an abstraction because it’s reusable
We provide a codebase, student writes about how it could be refactored
Binary files and raw bytes


-----------
midterm project features that are too advanced
------------
Operation for read-from-user-into-dataslot
Operation for show-data-slot-to-user
Data slots 1-9
Operation for skip next instruction if condition holds
So for extra credit student can code their own programs

Show a bar chart with stats on the types of cpu instructions for the current program
Because microprocessor a class you can have two instances computing things at the same time
like a multicore processor.
or you could run two in parallel and constantly check the registers to detect bugs

instances could 'register' operations
Extra credit: create a new operation

Base class for operation, child classes implement. E.g. base class can parse input into a list.
Shows some benefits of interfaces, can just call go() on them 

-------------
abandoned interactive store ideas
-------------
was originally the final project.
not interesting enough--basically the same as the coursemanagement from term 1 but with OOP.
FINAL PROJECT: INTERACTIVE STORE
interactive storefront with persisted state. Product catalog + shopping cart.
(Also reinforces a lot of programming-1 material)
Student should use OOP throughout
Example flow: run console app. Asks user for name. Program pulls latest inventory from json file on disk.
User sees a list of categories to buy, press 1 for shirts etc
User can add item to cart
If nothing in inventory for that, raise an error which is handled appropriately at a higher level
User can type in a promo code to get a 10% off their cart (a property on the cart class?)
User clicks ‘check out’, computes total using OOP (items.getPrice() and each has its own logic)
User can complete purchase, which persists to json file on disk
An admin view to show stats on purchases and display that data in matplotlib.
Must include working tests
Must be split into separate files


--------------
other final project ideas
--------------
Stateful program that persists between runs (could be a game high score, like reflexes game)
tic tac toe can run in different modes:
play against random-move computer
play against friend
