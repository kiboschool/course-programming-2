## What you'll learn

In this course, you'll build off of what you learned in Programming 1.

- You will use the tools you've learned to build more advanced programs:
programs that read from the internet, display information visually, and
interact with databases.
- You'll deepen our knowledge of software fundamentals - learning about
object-oriented software, how to recover from errors, and how data
is structured.
- Finally, you will begin to explore the philosophy of writing software.
This means going beyond "does my program compute the right thing",
but to ask if a program is well organized, if it will be readable by
other programmers, and if it will it be re-usable in other projects.

By the end of the course, you will understand what objects and classes are
(in other words, writing object-oriented programs),
you will be able to write more advanced programs:
interacting with data sources, using a language called SQL,
and creating graphics to visualize data. You will
also be structuring your code in more-professional ways.
Along the way you'll pick up tips on how to investigate programs that aren't working correctly, and gain experience reading and understanding code that other people have written.

Everything in the course will be valuable for doing real-world work in the field.


You aren't on this journey alone. We'll work on team projects and collaborate, and we'll communicate in discord and office hours to help answer questions.

## Important Notes

- Our main communication tool is Discord. You are fully responsible for checking Discord for announcements and updates.
- You are expected to attend all classes. If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up on the material.
- You are expected to complete all assignments on time. If for any reason you are unable to complete an assignment on time, you must contact the instructor before the deadline.Check the [late submission policy](lessons/course-projects.md#late-policy) for information on how late assignments are handled.
- Cheating is not tolerated. If you are caught cheating, you will be given a zero for the assignment and you will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee. Make sure you are familiar with the [Kibo School Academic Integrity Policy](lessons/course-projects.html#academic-integrity). You are expected to follow the policy in all your work.
- Make sure you check the [Getting help](lessons/asking-for-help.md) for information on how to get help with the course.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
  programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
  Python to try out your code and test that it works.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
- **Anchor** is our Learning Management System where you will consume your weekly lessons and submit your assignments (in addition to Gradescope)

## Live Classes

Each live class will have notes here that you should read before attending class.
Video recordings of the class will also be posted after the classes each week.

To access the code, you'll need to have joined the github classroom org and been
added to the team. Once you've joined the Github team by accepting an assignment
in github classroom, you can reach out in Discord to be added to the team.

## Additional Practice

If you finish the exercises (and you are up to date on your other courses), you 
can continue to practice programming.

We recommend that you start with the Exercism python track. If you complete it,
and complete the Python exercises, then you can move on to the other resources.

* [Exercism Python track](https://exercism.org/tracks/python)

These sites host programming problems to solve. They are often educational, and
can help when it is time to prepare for technical interviews. Sometimes the
problems are poorly written or hard to understand, in which case it might be a
problem to skip over for now.

* [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)

* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)


### Practice tips

* It's good to look at other solutions, but only after you've tried solving a
  problem. If you come up with a solution that works, try to notice how someone
  else solved the same problem, and what you might do to revise your solution.
* It can be good to try solving the same problem a second time, after some days
  or weeks have passed. Has the problem gotten easier, now that you have
  solved it before?
* It's fun to solve problems with friends. If you have a solution you really
  like, you can share it with the squad or community. Remember to use spoiler
  tags so that you don't ruin the problem in case someone else wants to try it.
* Practice should be challenging, but you shouldn't spend hours stuck on a 
  problem without making progress. If you are stuck, take a break, ask for help,
  try another problem, and return to the problem later.
* Take a break! It's often helpful to walk around, drink water, eat a bite of
  food, then return to a problem refreshed. Some problems that seem impossible
  become very easy when approached with a fresh mind.

## Asking for help

If you have any trouble understanding the concepts or stuck on a problem, we
expect you to reach out for help!

Below are the different ways to get help in this class.

### Discord channel 

The first place to go is always the #help-prog2 channel. Share your question
there so that your Instructor and your peers can help as soon as we can.

### Message your instructor on Discord

If your question doesn't get resolved within 24 hours on Discord, you can
reach out to your instructor directly via Discord DM.

### Office Hours

There will be weekly office hours with your Instructor and your TA.  Please make use of them!

### Tips on Asking For Help

When asking for help, include the following information:

1. Details of your goal.

   _"I am trying to [goal]."_

2. Details of what you have tried so far.

   _"I have tried [details of how you have tried to solve the problem already]."_

3. Helpful context.

   _“Here’s a screenshot of my code."_

**❌ Don’t Write**

- “need help”
- “I’m stuck on problem 3”
- “Can anyone help?”
- “Hi”

**✅ Do Write**

- “I’m working on solving problem three, and getting this error when I run my code: [screenshot]. Can anyone help explain this error? I don’t get it.”
- “I’m trying to print all the values in this list for my project, but it keeps saying `NameError: name ‘item’ is not defined`. Here's a screenshot of my code. I tried changing the list, but that didn't work."

### Screenshots

It’s often helpful to include a screenshot with your question. Here’s how:

- **Windows:** press the Windows key + Print Screen key
  - the screenshot will be saved to the Pictures > Screenshots folder
  - _alternatively: press the Windows key + Shift + S to open the snipping tool_
- **Mac:** press the Command key + Shift key + 4
  - it will save to your desktop, and show as a thumbnail

### Peer collaboration

You can work with your peers on exercises, and on some of the projects, as
specified in the project instructions.

When you work with a peer, be sure that you:

- **Collaborate effectively**: communicate with your peers about when you will meet
  and what you will do
- **Write code yourself**: do not just watch someone else solve the problem. You
  have to write lots of code in this course in order to succeed.
- **Read and understand your peers' code**: seeing how someone else solves a problem
  can help you learn new techniques, or you might have a better technique to
  share with your partner. If there's something in their code you are confused
  by, _ask_

## Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instuctor. Such requests must be made at least 24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student. Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.

## Academic Integrity

When you turn in an assignment, you are representing that the work is your own.
Copying work from another student or from online and submitting it is _plagiarism_.

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:

- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo

For more information about what counts as plagiarism and tips for working with
integrity, review the ["What is Plagiarism?" Video](https://youtu.be/2qmWz7Qvh0E)
