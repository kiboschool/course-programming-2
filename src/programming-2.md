## What you'll learn

In this course, you'll build off of what you learned in Programming 1.

- You will use the tools you've learned to build more advanced programs:
programs that read from the internet, display information visually, and
interact with databases.
- You'll deepen our knowledge of software fundamentals - learning about
object-oriented software, how to recover from errors, and how data
is structured.
- Finally, you will begin to explore the philosophy of writing software.
This means going beyond "does my program compute the right thing",
but to ask if a program is well organized, if it will be readable by
other programmers, and if it will it be re-usable in other projects.

By the end of the course, you will understand what objects and classes are
(in other words, writing object-oriented programs),
you will be able to write more advanced programs:
interacting with data sources, using a language called SQL,
and creating graphics to visualize data. You will
also be structuring your code in more-professional ways.
Along the way you'll pick up tips on how to investigate programs that aren't working correctly, and gain experience reading and understanding code that other people have written.

Everything in the course will be valuable for doing real-world work in the field.



You aren't on this journey alone. We'll work on team projects and collaborate, and we'll communicate in discord and office hours to help answer questions.

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Write exercises to try out the concepts
- Complete projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.

## Assessments

- 10% Exercises
- 40% Course Projects
- 25% Midterm Project
- 25% Final Project

## Important Notes

- Our main communication tool is Discord. You are fully responsible for checking Discord for announcements and updates.
- You are expected to attend all classes. If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up on the material.
- You are expected to complete all assignments on time. If for any reason you are unable to complete an assignment on time, you must contact the instructor before the deadline.Check the [late submission policy](lessons/course-projects.md#late-policy) for information on how late assignments are handled.
- Cheating is not tolerated. If you are caught cheating, you will be given a zero for the assignment and you will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee. Make sure you are familiar with the [Kibo School Academic Integrity Policy](lessons/course-projects.html#academic-integrity). You are expected to follow the policy in all your work.
- Make sure you check the [Getting help](lessons/asking-for-help.md) for information on how to get help with the course.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
  programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
  Python to try out your code and test that it works.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
