## What We'll Learn

In this course we'll build off of what we learned in Programming 1. We will use the tools we've learned to build more advanced programs: programs that read from the internet, display information visually, and interact with databases. We'll deepen our knowledge of software fundamentals - learning about object-oriented software, how to recover from errors, and how data is structured. Finally, we will begin to explore the philosophy of writing software. This means going beyond "does my program compute the right thing", but to ask questions like if is the program well-organized, if it will be readable by other programmers, and if it will it be re-usable in other projects.

At the end of the course we will be able to be comfortable writing Python programs to accomplish basic tasks, and to write tests to check that the code is working correctly. We will understand what objects and classes are (in other words, writing object-oriented programs). Along the way we'll pick up tips on how to investigate programs that aren't working correctly, and we'll gain experience reading and understanding code that other people have written. Everything in the course will be truly valuable for doing real-world work in the field.

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Practice with exercises to try out the concepts
- Complete projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
  programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
  Python to try out your code and test that it works.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
