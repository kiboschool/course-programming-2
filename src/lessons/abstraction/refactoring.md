We will also talk about refactoring. This means to make changes to the code, while still having it compute the same output in essentially the same way. For example, changing the name of a variable from 's' to 'user_name' does not change what the program does. Changing code from using functions to using methods on a class is a common type of refactoring. Even though refactoring does not change the functionality of the program, it is often a worthwhile change as long as the resulting code is easier to read or easier to make future modifications to.

* Learn ways refactoring can make code easier to read.
* Use named parameters as a way to refactor code. If a function takes a lot of parameters, this can be a good refactoring step.
