# Refactoring

### 

refactoring. This means to make changes to the code, while still having it compute the same output in essentially the same way. For example, changing the name of a variable from 's' to 'user_name' does not change what the program does. Changing code from using functions to using methods on a class is a common type of refactoring. Even though refactoring does not change the functionality of the program, it is often a worthwhile change as long as the resulting code is easier to read or easier to make future modifications to.
