# Abstraction in OOP



## Abstract Classes


The `Database` class code uses the ABC module to define an abstract class. ABC stands for Abstract Base Class. It also provides the `@abstractmethod` decorator to define abstract methods. The `@abstractmethod decorator` is used to mark a method as abstract. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains **no implementation**. Abstract classes can not be instantiated, and their abstract methods must be implemented by their subclasses.
