## Summary

Abstraction is a concept that allows us to hide unnecessary details from the user. It allows us to reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes.

In code, we can achieve abstraction by using abstract classes, functions, and modules.

In your code, you should try to use abstraction to reduce complexity and make your code easier to read, understand, and modify.

Here are a few tips to help you achieve abstraction in your code:

- Write good functions that abstract away implementation details from the user. Other functions and modules should be able to use your functions without knowing how they are implemented.
- Design good classes to hide implementation details from the user.
- Use abstract classes to define interfaces that other modules can use without knowing how they are implemented.
