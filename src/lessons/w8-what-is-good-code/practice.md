# Practice: Code Quality

## Required Practice

This week, you won't be doing a CodeCheck exercise for your practice; however,
you will be submitting some practice to Gradescope.  

Your task is as follows:

1. Read through [this website on Code
   Smells](https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/04-code-review/).
   Some of the examples used here are other than Python, but the concepts still
   apply.
2. Visit the Gradescope assignment
   ([/assignments/practice__code_quality.pdf](/assignments/practice__code_quality.pdf)),
   and answer some questions about what you've learned.

## Additional Practice

This practice section will focus on the concept of code reviews: Reading through
code in order to make it better, refactoring it as you see opportunities to do
so.

Let's start by watching the following video where you can see a small code
review in practice - you don't have to keep watching past _13:00_

Your practice is to apply the same spirit on your own!

- Reach out to a classmate and share a code snippet of yours with them for them
  to review, give them feedback on some of their code in exchange.
- Go through your midterm project code and review it. What improvements can you
  find?
- Go through your programming 1 final project and review it. What improvements
  can you find?

While we cover some big ideas in this week's content, here are a few other small
things to look for - these are often called "code smells":

- Are there poorly named variables?
- Is there repeated code?
- Are there random numbers used across the program?
- Is there inconsistent style and naming?
- Are there obvious ways to break the program?
