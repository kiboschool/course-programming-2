# Assignment 7: Code Reviews

This week, you won't be doing a GitHub programming exercise for your assignment.
Instead, you will perform code review exercises on GradeScope.  

Visit the Gradescope assignment
   ([/assignments/assignment_7__code_reviews.pdf](/assignments/assignment_7__code_reviews.pdf)),
   and answer some questions about what you've learned.

## Submitting Your Work

Your work must be submitted Anchor for degree credit and to Gradescope for grading.

**For coding tasks involving Github Classroom:**

1. Ensure that you `commit` and `push` your local code changes to your remote repository.  (Note: In general, you should commit and push frequently, so that you have a backup of your work, so that there is evidence that you did your own work, and so that you can return to a previous state easily.)
2. Upload your submission to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link by selecting the correct GitHub repository from the drop-down list.
3. Export a zip archive of your GitHub repository by visiting your repo on [GitHub](https://www.github.com), clicking on the green `Code` button, and selecting "Download Zip".
4. Upload the zip file of your repository to Anchor using the form below.

**For cases where you answer questions on Gradescope:**

1. Complete the work in [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) by navigating tot he appropriate link.
2. Export it as a pdf using th Google Chrome plugin: [https://gofullpage.com/](https://gofullpage.com/).  This plugin will do multiple screen captures while scrolling through your document, and then stitch them into a pdf that you can download.
3. Upload the generated pdf to Anchor using the form below.

**For any work completed outside of GitHub or Gradescope:**

1. Take either screen captures of your work or export a pdf showing your complete work.
2. Submit the materials to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) via the appropriate submission link for the course.
3. Upload the screen captures or pdf files to Anchor using the form below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your work to
> Anchor before the last day of the term.  Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the late deadline, if applicable).
