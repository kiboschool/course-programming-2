# OOP: Knowledge Check

These interactive quizzes can help you check what you understand about class syntax and inheritance.

First, a quick quiz from Real Python:
- [Real Python: Object Oriented Programming Quiz](https://realpython.com/quizzes/pybasics-oop/)

Practice the different types of exercises from chapter 16 of [Python for Everybody - Interactive edition](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/index.html):

- [Multiple Choice Questions](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/objects/Exercises.html)
- [Practice Problems](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/objects/fl-toggle-cls.html)
- [Practice Problems - Write Code](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/objects/fl-write-cls.html)
- [Mixed-up Code Exercises](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/objects/mixedupcode_orig.html)
- [Knowledge Review](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/py4e-int/objects/intro-fl-cls.html)

If you can confidently solve the problems, then try the post test to confirm your grasp of objects! 

If not, it's a good time to review the material before returning to try the post-test later.
