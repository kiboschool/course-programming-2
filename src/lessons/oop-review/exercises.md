> ðŸ’¡ This is your chance to put what youâ€™ve learned into action.

### Submission

> **[Use this form](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

You are required to submit documentation for 10 exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1%
of your overall grade.

* You are welcome to log work that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
exercises page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

## Submitting an assignment

When you are done, `commit` and `push` your code. Submit a link to your work on
Github using this form: **[Programming Exercise log](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**.

Be sure that the link you submit will take the instructor directly to your code.
