# Project: OOP Course Manager

In this project, you'll build on the course manager project from Programming 1. You'll work with an Object-oriented version of the application, using inheritance, custom errors, and the SQLAlchemy ORM.

You'll also add new functionality to the project, and see how the class-based approach makes it easier to separate concerns
and handle tasks in isolation.

## Submission

In order to get credit for your project, you must:

- push your code to Github Classroom
- submit your work in Gradescope
- submit your project in Woolf

Take care that your code passes all of the automated tests. We're using the Gradescope autograding feature, which assigns most of the points automatically based on the unit tests.
