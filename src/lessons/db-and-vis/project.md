In this project, you'll build on the course manager project from Programming 1. You'll work with an Object-oriented version of the application, using inheritance, custom errors, and the SQLAlchemy ORM.

You'll also add new functionality to the project, and see how the class-based approach makes it easier to separate concerns
and handle tasks in isolation.
