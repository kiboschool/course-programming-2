# Querying Data



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



Discuss ‘querying data’
Recall the clothes example, Shirts, colors, pocketColors.
How would we do a search where we want to look for all in the list with Size=M, color=White?
Quickly move on from this example (the structures there had inheritance parents/children but sql is flat)
Or what if we had a data set with world cup player names, minutes played, goals scored, shots on goal, yellow cards, red cards, country, appearances?
Show code example with a list of player stats instances
Show the loops to filter that way, builds off of filters in programming-1
What if there were a concise way to express that, rather than lots of lines of code
And what if a schema could enforce structure, since python’s lists are too flexible
Show writing sql queries: from country x and position = y and appearances > 10
Limit 5, Order by goals_scored desc
Insert, update, delete
