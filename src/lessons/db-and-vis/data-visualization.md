Data vis

Data vis.
We provide a bar chart showing number of apps for players in a country. Modify it to show number of goals in a different country.
We provide scatter plot with shots on goal vs time played. Draw the plot again with your fake players. Draw plot with goals scored vs time played, maybe there is a trend there too. Draw plot with yellow cards vs shots on goal, would be interesting to see if players that foul also better scorers? Send your fun discoveries out to discord!

Can show weather temperature over time

Show scatter plot with shots on goal vs time played. Should be a trend upwards, more time someone plays = more time for them to take shots. And can identify really good young players.
