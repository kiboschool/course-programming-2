> ðŸ’¡ This is your chance to put what youâ€™ve learned into action.

### Submission

> **[Use this form](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

You are required to submit documentation for 10 exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1%
of your overall grade.

* You are welcome to log work that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
exercises page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

* Then, run the program and get the answers

## Visualizing data

* Look inside the database and get the codes for different positions, such as `FW` for forward or `GK` for goalkeeper. You can do this by opening the `.db` file in a tool like `DB Browser for Sqlite`, or by writing a script to loop through player rows and print out the `.position`.
* Modify the code to generate other charts to answer the questions.

### Logging your practice

When you are done, `commit` and `push` your code. Submit a link to your work on
Github using this form: **[Programming Exercise log](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**.

Be sure that the link you submit will take the instructor directly to your code.
