# Reading and Writing Data

Welcome to Week One of the Programming 2 course!

We will start by reviewing some topics from the Programming 1 course. It will be important to remember `list`s, `dict`s, and how to read and write files.

Next we will talk about ways to organize data in memory. For example, we can use dicts, or a dict of dicts, when we store data in memory.

Then, we will learn how to write programs that reads and parse data from the internet.

## Learning Objectives

Here's a list of what we will cover this week,

- Reviewing lists and dicts.
- Discussing ways to organize data in memory.
- We will introduce a format called "JSON" that will let us store lists and dicts into a file.
- Finally, we'll learn how to read data from the internet! There is a type of internet website called an "API", and we can write a program to ask an API to send us data. For example, we'll write a program that connects to a weather API to retrieve data about the weather forecast.
