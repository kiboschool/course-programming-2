# Reading and Writing Data

Welcome to Week One of Programming 2!

This week, we will begin with a preview, where we will demonstrate the topics 
the course will cover. We'll then review some topics from Programming 1. It will 
be important to remember `list`s, `dict`s, and how to read and write files. 
Next we will talk about ways to organize data for easier access. You'll see how 
to use dicts in ways that make accessing data easier and more organized.

By the end of the course, you will be able to write more advanced programs: 
interacting with data sources, using SQL to interact with databases, and 
creating graphics to visualize data. You will also learn to work with Object 
Oriented code, which will let you structure data and behavior into natural
groups that make applications easier to reason about.

## Learning Objectives

Here's a list of what we will cover this week:

* A course preview, showing what we'll be able to build at the end of the course.
* A review of lists and dicts.
* Using dicts 
* We will introduce a format called "JSON" that will let us store lists and 
  dicts in files.
* We will practice reading data from the internet, using APIs
