# Reading and Writing Data

Welcome to Week One of the Programming 2 course!

We will begin with a preview, where we will demonstrate some of the topics the class will be learning. By the end of the course, you will be able to write more advanced programs: interacting with data sources, using a language called SQL, and creating graphics to visualize data. You will also be structuring your code in more-professional ways.

We'll then review some topics from the Programming 1 course. It will be important to remember `list`s, `dict`s, and how to read and write files.

Next we will talk about ways to organize data in memory. For example, we can use dicts, or  a dict of dicts, when we store data in memory. Later on, when our program reads data the code will be simpler to write because it is stored in a more-organized way.

## Learning Objectives

Here's a list of what we will cover this week,

* A course preview, showing what we'll be able to build at the end of the course.
* Reviewing lists and dicts.
* Discussing ways to organize data in memory.
* We will introduce a format called "JSON" that will let us store lists and dicts into a file.
* Finally, we'll learn how to read data from the internet! There is a type of internet website called an "API", and we can write a program to ask an API to send us data. For example, we'll write a program that connects to a weather API to retrieve data about the weather forecast.
