# Introduction to Inheritence



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



Introduce inheritance. 

The persistedlist class-what if we also wanted to add logging.

version one of the code:
no save method, everything is duplicated

then a version with a save method

then a version with a shouldLog 

but this can gum up the functionality-what if sometimes you need to log to a file, sometimes you need to log to console, sometimes you need to include the time in a different format. sometimes you only need to log on deletes, not on adds. needs a lot of if/thens.

one way to do this is with composition-
show example-
but this is inflexible and needs a lot of typing, kind of fragile and you'd have to update it when any of the methods change

one solution for this is called inheritence!

by default it does what the parent class does.
