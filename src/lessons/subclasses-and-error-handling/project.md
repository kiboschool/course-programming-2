# Project: OOP Course Manager

<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------

In this project, you'll build on the course manager project you saw in
Programming 1. You'll write an Object-oriented version of the application,
filling in the method stubs. You'll also add new functionality to the project,
and see how the class-based approach makes it easier to separate concerns
and handle tasks in isolation.
