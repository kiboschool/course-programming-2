Clothes example
Like an item in the shopping cart for an online clothes store
Shirt class, init method and getCost() method. Color and pocketColor property. Cheaper if color==stripesColor.
Jacket class, init method and getCost() method. No pocketColor property.
There is some repeated code - isValidSize() ‘M’ ‘S’ ‘XL’ and isValidMaterial() and getCostPerSqrFoot().
Can pull this into a parent ClothingArticle class to get the shared logic and shared member vars
Child classes can call the parent
