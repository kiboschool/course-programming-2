Take a clothing store model, ArticleOfClothing

Tools to help us in the process of working on classes
---------------------------------------------------------------
We are writing a complicated piece of code
We can write rough drafts of our code.
Kind of like when I added just a print statement to see it get called.
mention pass
mention the __str__ dunder

Overriding and dunders
Mention that a child class can override parent methods
Introduce __str__ dunder, and just say that some methods are special, no need to elaborate further

if you are interested you can write unders for adding and comparing
