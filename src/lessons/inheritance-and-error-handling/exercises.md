# Exercises

1)

Navigating a program with many classes:

Read the object-oriented weather data program.

At the bottom of the file, write two lines of code.

get the wind speed at Accra at time point 5

2)

In programming-1, one of the practice exercises was to write a program that found the area of a circle. First the program asked the user to type in a number. Then it computed the area, which is pi * radius * radius. Then, it

Write a program to read the contents of a file. The contents will be a string, so use `float` to turn it into a decimal number. Then, show the area of a circle with that radius. Use exception handling so that if the file does not have a number, show the message "not a number".


3) 
Make a child class of the GenericPersistedList class called ResetablePersistedList.

Add a method on that class called `reset()`. It should reset the current list so that it will then be set to an empty list with no contents.

I have added a \_\_str\_\_ method to make printing the contents easier.

Write a handful of lines of test code, and use `print` to show the contents, to confirm that the reset() method works as expected.
