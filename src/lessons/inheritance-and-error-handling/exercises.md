# Exercises

* Edit main.py
* Write a short script to show the area of a circle
    * First ask the user to type in a number for radius, by using `input()`
    * Use `float()` to convert what the user typed into a decimal number
    * Then compute the area, which is pi * radius * radius
    
<img src="../../images/w3/circle.png" width="20%" height="20%"  style="border:none, border-width: 0, border: 0; box-shadow: 0px 0px;" />

* If the user does not type in a number, for example if they type in letters, show the message "not a number" and exit.
    * Hint: this is an example of exception handling.
    * `try` and `except` will be useful tools.

-----------

* Edit main.py
* Create a child class of the `GenericPersistedList` class called `ResetablePersistedList`.
* Add a method on that child class called `reset()`. It should set the current list to `[]`, (an empty list).
* Write some code at the bottom of the file that creates a `ResetablePersistedList` check that `reset` works.
