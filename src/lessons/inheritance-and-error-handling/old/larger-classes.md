# Larger Classes



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



So far you’ve seen smallish classes. But from now on we’ll focus on larger classes that refer to other classes, since that shows the value of OOP even better.
Show an example: madlibs class. Base class does substitution. One implementation asks input from user. One implementation pulls from random list.
Note that they share the same “interface”.
What are cases for OOP? (we won’t cover all of these, but for reference)
carve the problem space into separate places, to solve separate problems
interfaces + encapsulation, hides details+allows future implementation changes
don't have to pass as much state as params
concept of nouns+verbs
polymorphism/easy to extend if all use same interface
inheritance can be a way to reuse code
typesafety and vscode autocomplete
