# Overriding

## Interface

There is another benefit to inheritance. Because the methods get copied in, the new class will have essentially the same methods. We could change out the PersistedListToLines and the PersistedListToFile


madlibs example
Base class does substitution. One implementation asks input from user. One implementation pulls from random list.
