## Debugging Mysteries

Debugging is about investigating. Finding out information, forming hypotheses, testing them, and checking what you learned. 

> The **[Debugging Mysteries](https://mysteries.wizardzines.com/)** are guided, interactive debugging stories. You'll debug 5 mysterious problems.

These aren't all _Python_ debugging mysteries. They are mostly about networking, and touch on software concepts you may not have seen yet. Still, the debugging process is the same! Find out information, form hypotheses, and test them.

## Rectangle Area Bug

Practice using pdb to debug a small function. [Clone this repo](https://github.com/joaks1/python-debugging) and follow the steps in the Readme to solve the bug.

## "Spot the error"

Sometimes, you can read some code and spot what is going wrong. Practice training your eye to spot bugs by reading these [debugging exercises on dev.to](https://dev.to/msoup/python-debugging-exercises-145h).

## Bug Postmortem

You'll encounter authentic bugs all the time as you build software.

Was there a bug you encountered in your last project? What caused it? How did you solve it?

A _[Postmortem](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/learn/incident-postmortem/)_ is a process for analyzing what happened in an incident. Try writing an incident report that explains the bug. Include:

- A high-level summary of what happened
- A root cause analysis. What were the origins of failure? Why do you think this happened?
- Steps taken to diagnose, assess, and resolve. What actions were taken? Which were effective? Which were detrimental?
- A timeline of significant activity
- Learnings and next steps. What went well? What didnâ€™t go well? How do you prevent this issue from happening again?
