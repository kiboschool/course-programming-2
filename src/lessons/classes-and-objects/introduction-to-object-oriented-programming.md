# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



Introduce OOP. A class defines a ‘template’. Each instance behaves similarly to a dict with methods
A dict is also an ‘object’ that has state and methods, but there’s not a way to add your own .x .y .myMethod()
Point class (not perfect, but it does show how instances are independent)
(Having a point class also gives member names like x and y which is easier to read than [0] and [1])
You can make a list of Point instances
(Let’s say you have a list of points. having a point class vs a tuple makes it easier to not have bugs where only one coord is there, since tuples have no enforcement)
Recurring theme: better structuring the data is a way to have better constraints, which are a way to make code more resilient


Point example
    Point class
    Print-current-position method
    Get-distance-from-origin method
    Is-y-coordinate-greater-than-10 method
