# Another Example Class

The most important information from the video:

* Using classes instead of dictionaries can help us see failures before running the program, because the class will document what attributes are available. A dictionary, on the other hand, doesn't describe what data is present, you need to read the code, or there needs to be another source of documentation.
* Using classes instead of dictionaries will help us make changes to the program in the future, because we can use VSCode's autocomplete to pick from a list of available attributes and methods.  I recommend installing the VSCode extension called "Pylance".
* The video also shows that functions can return instances of classes, methods in a class can call other methods, and lists can contain instances of classes.
