Some of what we learned in the video:

* Using classes instead of dictionaries can help us see failures before running the program, because the class will describe what attributes are available. We know that an instance of the `Point` class will always have an `x` attribute and a `y` attribute. A dictionary, on the other hand, doesn't describe what is there, we would need to read the code or look at documentation that someone wrote.
* Using classes instead of dictionaries can help us make changes to the program in the future, because we can use autocomplete to pick from the available attributes and methods.  I recommend installing the VSCode extension called "Pylance".
* The video also shows that we can create an instance of class inside a function. Also, methods in a class can call other methods. Finally, the video discussed how breaking a method into smaller methods can be helpful.
