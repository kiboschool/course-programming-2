Point Class
write code that creates three different point instances
one of them at the coordinates (2, 2)
one of them at the coordinates (0, 0)
one of them at the coordinates (-2, -2)


Point Class has a moveTo(x, y) method
Fix three bugs:
    1) indendation is wrong
    2) missing self in methods
    3) __init instead of __init__
