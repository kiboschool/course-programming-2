> **Remember**: Complete two or more of the three tasks in order to earn full marks.

### Submission

> **[Use this form](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

You are required to submit documentation for 10 exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1%
of your overall grade.

* You are welcome to log work that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
exercises page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.

Your log will count for credit as long as it:
- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work


We recommend that you complete at least two of these exercises.


## Creating Instances (1 point)

<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/Zors5n83" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Open%20Project&message=Classes%20Exercise:%20Creating%20Instances&color=blue" alt="Classes Exercise: Creating Instances" /></a>
<!-- https://github.com/kibo-programming-2-jan-23/classes-exercise-creating-instances -->

Using the Point class that is already there in the file, please do this:
* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (0, 0) and put it in a variable named `first_instance`
* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (0, 2) and put it in a variable named `second_instance`
* Create an instance of the Point class with coordinates (2, 0) and put it in a variable named `third_instance`
* On `first_instance`, write a call to the `move_right()` method.
* Try running the program, and confirm that there are no errors that show up.

## Fixing Bugs (1 point)

<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/NxxxDvIJ" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Open%20Project&message=Classes%20Exercise:%20Fixing%20Bugs&color=blue" alt="Classes Exercise: Fixing Bugs" /></a>
<!-- https://github.com/kibo-programming-2-jan-23/classes-exercise-fixing-bugs
 -->
 
The `main.py` file isn't working, because there are mistakes in the code.

* There are 3 problems.
* Fix the mistakes in the program so that it works as expected.
* Try running the program, and confirm that there are no errors that show up.

(Hint: refer to the *Bugs To Watch Out For* video.)

## Writing a Method (1 point)

<a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/Arc0Vkqh" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Open%20Project&message=Classes%20Exercise:%20Writing%20a%20Method&color=blue" alt="Classes Exercise: Writing a Method" /></a>
<!-- https://github.com/kibo-programming-2-jan-23/classes-exercise-writing-a-method -->

Please edit `main.py`, and do the following:

* Run the program and see what it does.
* Add a new method called `print_contents` that reads the contents of the file, and uses print to show the results.
* At the bottom of the file, have the `test_file` call the new `print_contents` method.
* Try running the program, and confirm that there are no errors that show up.

(Hint: there is information about reading from files [here](https://programming-1.vercel.app/lessons/files/basic_file_operations.html).)


## Submitting an assignment

When you are done, `commit` and `push` your code. Submit a link to your work on
Github using this form: **[Programming Exercise log](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**.

Be sure that the link you submit will take the instructor directly to your code.

<aside>

**If you get stuck**
1. Read the instructions again.
2. Remember **G**o **C**limb **K**ibo - first Google, then ask the Community on Discord, then reach out to Kibo instructional team.
