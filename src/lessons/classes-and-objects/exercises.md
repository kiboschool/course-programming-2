# 1. Creating instances

Using the Point class from the lessons, create three different point instances
- one at coordinates (2, 2)
- one at coordinates (0, 0)
- one at coordinates (-2, -2)

Use the `copy` module to create a copy of the first point and use `move_right` to move it to the right.

# 2. Fix bugs in a method

The Point class has a `move_to(x, y)` method.

Fix three bugs:

1) indentation is wrong

2) missing `self` in methods

3) `__init` instead of __init__ 
 
# 3. Write a method

File Helper

we call this a helper because it is simpler to write `.get_contents()` than `with open() as f`.

File('test.txt')

self.currentfilename

method deleteFile()

method getContents()

method appendToFile('abc')

assignment: add a setContentsTo(s) method

## Submitting the assignment

When you are done, `commit` and `push` your code. Submit a link to your work on
Github using this form: **[Programming Exercise log](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

Be sure that the link you submit will take the instructor directly to your code.
