# \# 1. Creating instances

Point Class
    write code that creates three different point instances
    one of them at the coordinates (2, 2)
    one of them at the coordinates (0, 0)
    one of them at the coordinates (-2, -2)
    create a copy of the first point and use moveRight to move it to the right.


# \# 2. Fixing bugs

Point Class has a moveTo(x, y) method
    Fix three bugs:
    1) indendation is wrong
    2) missing self in methods
    3) __init instead of __init__ 
    
# \# 3. Writing a method

File Helper
    we call this a helper because it is simpler to write .getContents() than with open() as f.
    File('test.txt')
    self.currentfilename
    method deleteFile()
    method getContents()
    method appendToFile('abc')
    assignment: add a setContentsTo(s) method

## Submitting the assignment

When you are done, `commit` and `push` your code. Submit a link to your work on
Github using this form: **[Programming Exercise log](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**
