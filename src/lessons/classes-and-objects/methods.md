# Methods



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



Classes have methods

moveLeft()
moveRight()
moveUp()
moveDown()
possible methods


Could be a file helper.
File('test.txt')
method setContentsTo('abc')
method getContents()
method deleteFile()

shows how to hide details


Could be a list helper that always writes things to disk.
that way if the program crashes half way through it will always have a copy on disk
SavedList()
    method insert()
    method append()
        lst.append()
        self.save()
    method removeLastItem()
    method remove(which)
        lst
    method modify(which, newcontents)
    


Can compose classes:
class Triangle
    point1
    point2
    point3
