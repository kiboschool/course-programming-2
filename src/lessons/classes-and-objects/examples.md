Weather example
    CurrentWeather class with temperature, rain chances, pressure
    Methods to show temperature in celsius, in fahrenheit
    CurrentWeekWeather class with city name, day, and list of (CurrentWeather, time) tuples
    Why is it more useful to structure the data this way? One reason is that Weather.getByCity(‘lagos’).getUpcomingDay(‘3’).temperature is easier to read than looping through the raw data. Semantics help us write code.
