# Classes and Objects

In this week we will dive into a new topic. It's possible you have heard terms like "objects", "classes", or "object-oriented programming". We will learn about what these terms mean - they are a new way to write your code.

In the past, you have seen "variables" where you can store a value in memory. (Remember that when you write `name = input("What is your name?"` or `x = 5`, we call `name` and `x` variables.)

You have also seen "functions" where you can write some code to do a certain action or solve a certain problem. (Functions are the lines that start with `def`.)

An "object" is stored in a variable, and can have a few of its own functions attached to it. We will explain this further in the next few pages.

## Learning Objectives

Here is what we will be exploring this week,

* Introduce the concepts of objects and classes. A "class" essentially defines a template for creating objects.
* We will talk about "methods", which is the name of the functions attached to an object. You will be able to write your own methods.
* Classes can sometimes be complicated, and it's hard to get all of the code working on the first try. You will learn a way to sketch your program, to type down your ideas and not worry that the code does not work yet, which we call "pseudocode".
* After writing pseudocode you can gradually revise the code to make it closer to a working program. It can be useful in these revisions to write "stubs", like an empty method that intentionally doesn't have code there yet, but will in the future as the program becomes more complete.
* We can write `pass` in our empty method. It  is a placeholder to help us create a stub.
