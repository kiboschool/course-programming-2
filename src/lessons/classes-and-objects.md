# Classes and Objects

In this week we will dive into a new topic. It's possible you have heard terms like "objects", "classes", or "object-oriented programming". We will learn about what these terms mean - they are a new way to write your code.

In the past, you have seen variables where you can store a *value*. (Remember that when you write `name = input("What is your name?")` or `x = 5`, we call `name` and `x` variables. The values are a `string` and an `int` respectively.)

You have also seen *functions* where you can write some code to do a certain action or solve a certain problem. (Functions are the lines that start with `def`.)

An *object* is a different concept. In a way, it combines values and functions. It is a value that both holds data, and has its own functions. We will explain this further in the next few pages.

## Learning Objectives

Here is what we will be exploring this week,

* Introduce the concepts of objects and classes. A "class" essentially defines a template for creating objects.
* We will talk about "methods", which is the name of the functions attached to an object. You will be able to write your own methods.
* We will warn about aliasing. Two different names can point to the same object, which can lead to bugs in the program.
