# Classes and Objects

You may have heard the terms "objects", "classes", or "object-oriented 
programming". This week, you'll learn what these terms mean. 

In the past, you have seen _variables_ where you can store a value, like `name = input("What is your name?")` or `x = 5`. The values are a `string` and an `int` respectively.

You have also seen _functions_, where you can write some code to do a certain action or solve a certain problem.

An _object_ combines values and functions. It is a value that holds data, and has its own functions. 

## Learning Objectives

Here is what we will be exploring this week:

* Classes and Objects. A class defines a template for creating objects.
* Methods, which are functions attached to an object.
* Aliasing. Two different names can point to the same object, which can lead to bugs.
