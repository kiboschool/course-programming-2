    • Outline
        ◦ Introduce testing
        ◦ Show testing examples
        ◦ Introduce refactoring (incorporating thoughts on readability from week 6)
            ▪ New theme - higher level of thinking about coding, not just what, but why. Rob: Decomposition, Objects, what is ‘good’, why certain strategies / tips help to avoid kinds of problems
            ▪ Refactoring to reuse code. We’ve seen lots of places in the CourseManager project that show a list, edit, remove. Could create one ListManager, that would be more complicated, but would also eliminate lots of code. Note that more branches = more possible bugs, where as passing in plain data is often safer.
        ◦ Discuss how testing can help with refactoring (pinning)
        ◦ Writing test cases on the boundaries to catch the most bugs
        ◦ Writing test cases where the branches are to catch the most bugs (follow each branch, ‘coverage’)
        ◦ Writing test cases whenever a bug has been identified, that indicates it’s a weak part
        ◦ Discuss assert (for checking data) and how it makes code less fragile
        ◦ Convert from position parameters to named parameters - named params can be less fragile
