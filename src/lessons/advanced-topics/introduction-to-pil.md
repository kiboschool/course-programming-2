# Introduction to PIL



<!--

------------------------------- in progress -------------------------------



    • Outline
        ◦ (We can also use this week as a buffer depending on progress of previous classes)
        ◦ (Don’t put “images” in the week topic, because we might rush the images part depending on class progress)
        ◦ Review previous weeks
        ◦ Render to a graphical user interface
            ▪ mention the terms GUI, pygame, tkinter, pyqt
            ▪ go no further unless there’s time.
        ◦ Running a process - will be used by tic-tac-toe example to show the image
        ◦ Drawing with PIL
        ◦ Measurement / benchmarking / algorithms
            ▪ Speed of reading from internet vs reading disk vs reading from memory
            ▪ Dicts are usually faster than lists that have to loop
            ▪ Sets are a way to have a dict that just indicates presence
        ◦ If time, mention type safety
            ▪ (quickly show code but no runnable exercise or replit because it’s not worth spending time on yet)
        ◦ If time, comprehensions?
        ◦ If time, look at a nontrivial open source project
    • Code Examples (some provided by us, some left to be written by students)
        ◦ Example running a process
        ◦ Example running a process - to show an image - 
            ▪ eog test.jpg mspaint test.jpg open test.jpg  open -a test.jpg qlmanage -p filename.jpg
        ◦ Example drawing lines/rect/circle/other pngs with PIL and saving to png
        ◦ Student can draw a shape
