# SQL and Data Visualization

So far, you've usually saved files by writing them to disk in a JSON format. This works well for small projects, but in this week you'll look at another way to write files.

You'll be working with **databases**, like you saw in the Web Applications course. Databases work very well when you have very large data sets, like if you are creating the next Facebook and you need a place to store every single comment that people have ever written.

<!--
While we're on the topic of large data sets, we will talk about how to show visualizations of the data. This can help us see trends and understand the data. For our next-Facebook example we could create a data visualization of number-of-comments per day and if it looks like a line going up and to the right, this means our website is getting more and more active!

## Topics

* Writing code that uses a database to store data
* Using an ORM, a way to work with databases using classes and objects
<!--
* Using a library called Matplotlib that can help us visualize data.
