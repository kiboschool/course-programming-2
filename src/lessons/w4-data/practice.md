# Practice: Data I/O

## Required Practice

Complete the exercises using the link below.  Note that these exercises are additional practice with loops instead of Data I/O.  You are encouraged to independently practice with the additional practice items further down.

[https://codecheck.io/assignment/23102524384ucfd8gqtlpyc51x8w694510n](https://codecheck.io/assignment/23102524384ucfd8gqtlpyc51x8w694510n)

When you start the exercise, you will be given a `CodeCheck ID`.  You must **save this ID and the private URL** so that you can return to your work later!  If you don't save the private URL (which contains the `CodeCheck ID`), you will have to start the exercise from the beginning.  We will re-use this site throughout the term, so I recommend creating a document on your computer where you will save the private URLs for the whole term.

After you have completed the exercise, submit your `CodeCheck ID` to GradeScope using the following link:

For submission to Anchor, please take a screen capture of each of your solutions (5 in total for this assignment) and submit them below.
