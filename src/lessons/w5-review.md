# Reviewing What You've Learned

This week is devoted to practicing and applying what you have learned so far in
both Programming 1 and Programming 2.  Instead of focusing on learning
new material for the week, you will devote your time to completing a larger
scale project than what you have done so far this term.  

Remember to start on this project early!  There are multiple steps to complete,
and it represents a larger portion of your final grade that prior assignments.
