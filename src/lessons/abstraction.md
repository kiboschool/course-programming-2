# Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming that is used to simplify complex systems by focusing on their essential characteristics or features, while hiding their unnecessary details from the users.

For example, in the real world, a car is a complex system that has many different parts. But when you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine works or how the brakes work. You just need to know how to use the steering wheel and the pedals to drive the car. This is abstraction.

In programming, For example, when we use the `print()` function, we don't need to know how the computer prints things to the screen. We just need to know how to use the `print()` function.

You can abstract, hide unnecessary details of, data or behavior (implementation).
