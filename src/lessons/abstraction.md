# Abstraction

Abstraction is a concept in software development that helps people write better code.

The idea is to focus on essential characteristics, and hide unnecessary details. This way, even a complex system will not be difficult to work with.

In this week, you will:

* Learn how abstraction can make code easier to understand
* Learn how thinking about interfaces can make code flexible for future changes
* Learn how to write methods in a class that are marked as abstract

*(Note: You will not need to use abstraction in your final project).*
