# Abstraction

Abstraction is a concept in software development that helps people write better code.

The idea is to focus on essential characteristics, and hide unnecessary details. This way, even a complex system will not be difficult to work with.

In this week, you will:

* Learn how abstraction can make your code easier to read and work with
* Learn how thinking about interfaces can make code more flexible for future changes
* Learn about object-oriented programming concepts, including abstract methods

*(Note: You will not need to use abstraction in your final project).*
