# Inheritance and Error-handling

In this week, we will continue last week's topic of Classes. There is a way to create a class that uses information from another class. This is called making a "child class". Child classes can be used to model cases where the program should sometimes run in a different mode - the child class can work mostly the same as the parent class, but have different behavior or added features in some cases.

You have probably seen that when something goes wrong in your program, Python will say there was an "Error" or "Exception" when it dumps out information to your screen when the program crashes. In this week we will talk about precisely what is happening when a program crashes this way.

And there is also a way to stop the program from crashing by intercepting an error. The structure to do this is called `try` and `except`. 

Finally, we will show some tools that assist in the process of writing larger programs and making classes. This is a section on `pseudocode`, the `pass` statement, and the `__str__` method.

After this week, you'll be able to handle exceptions in your programs, and be able to use inheritance to write better classes.
