# Inheritance and Error-handling

This week, we will continue learning about Classes. Specifically, we'll focus on 
_Inheritance_: a way to share behavior between a parent class and child classes. 

Child classes work mostly the same as the parent class, but have different, 
specialized behavior, added features, or adaptations.

We'll also focus on Error handling. When something goes wrong and your program
crashes, Python prints an "Error" or "Exception" and dumps out information to 
your screen. You'll learn precisely what happens when a program crashes this way.

As you may have seen, you can stop the program from crashing by intercepting an 
error, using `try` and `except`.

Finally, you'll see some tools that assist in the process of writing larger 
programs and making classes. You'll revisit `pseudocode`, the `pass` statement, 
and the `__str__` method.

After this week, you'll be able to handle exceptions and share behavior between
classes using inheritance.
