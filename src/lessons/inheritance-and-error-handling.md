# Inheritance and Error-handling

This week, we will continue learning about object-oriented programming. Specifically, we'll focus on _Encapsulation_ and
_Inheritance_.

**Encapsulation** is a way to group related data and behavior together.

**Inheritance** is a way to share behavior between classes. You can do this by defining a class to be a child of another class.

Child classes work mostly the same as the parent class, but have different,
specialized behavior, added features, or adaptations.

We'll also focus on Error handling. When something goes wrong and your program
crashes, Python prints an "Error" or "Exception" and dumps out information to
your screen. You'll learn precisely what happens when a program crashes this way.

As you may have seen, you can stop the program from crashing by intercepting an
error, using `try` and `except`.

Finally, you'll see some tools that assist in the process of writing larger
programs and making classes. You'll revisit `pseudocode`, the `pass` statement,
and the `__str__` method.

After this week, you'll be able to handle exceptions and share behavior between
classes using inheritance.
