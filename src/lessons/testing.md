# Testing

At this point, you have probably encountered some Python test files. You may have noticed that in Kibo's projects, there has often been a file in the directory for testing.

For example, when you worked on the OOP Jukebox project, there was a `test_jukebox.py` file.

Running that file will run some code to check that the project was working as intended: this is an example of testing in Python.

In this week:

* you'll learn about how these test files work, and how to create your own.
* you'll be given tips on how to write effective tests.
* you'll learn about a type of automated test called a 'unit test'.
