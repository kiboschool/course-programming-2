# Advanced Topics

There are so many exciting areas in computer science to explore! This week we will touch on some concepts, and also leave some time to begin work on final projects.

We'll discuss areas like these:

* Most importantly, drawing graphics and save them to image files. We will use a library called PIL for this.
* The apps you see running on your computer are internally called "processes". We'll learn how to launch a separate process from Python.
* The programs you've written in this course have been run in a terminal, and show the output as printing text out to the screen. You've also written programs in a web browser that can have buttons to click on and forms to enter information. There is a way to create programs that aren't running in a web browser but have windows, buttons, and forms, this is called a GUI.
* Some programs run quickly, and some programs run slowly. In fact, there could be two Python programs that compute exactly the same data, but one of them could run a lot faster than the other. We would say that the faster program has better "performance". One way to get better performance is to choose a good "algorithm" (essentially the method of getting the output.)
* A `set` is similar to a `dict` and can be useful for some common algorithms.
