# Revision week

We have two key objectives this week:
1. Making sure that key concepts from this course are well understood.
2. Get started on the final assessment.

There will not be new content, nor a weekly assignment. If you want to revisit old assignments, or spend more time on difficult concepts, this is the time to do it.

Note that you also have access to the final assessment now, and will have until the end of next week to submit it. You should plan to start the assignment this week, as it is **significantly larger** than what you have worked on so far. It is not significantly more complex, but it has many requirements. Budget your time wisely. You should make sure that you have _read_ through the assignment before office hours, so you can use them if any requirement is unclear.

Make the best out of this recap week, and enjoy your new project!
