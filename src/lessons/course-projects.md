# Course Projects

During some weeks, you'll be given a project involving the new skills and concepts you
learned. There will be a project for **Subclasses and Error-handling**, **Tests and Refactoring**, and **Abstraction**.

The projects will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will also be a midterm project and a final project, described on the next
pages.

# Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- No assignments will be accepted more than 48 hours after the original due date.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instuctor. Such requests must be made at least 24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student. Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.

- If a student repeatedly fails to submit assignments on time, or fails to request an extension in a timely manner, the instructor may take disciplinary action, which could include lowering the student's grade or dismissing them from the course.
