# Course Projects

During some weeks, you'll be given a project involving the new skills and concepts you learned.

The projects will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will also be a midterm project and a final project.

## Projects List

Below are the projects you'll be working on in this course:

- Course Project 1: OOP Course Manager
- Course Project 2: Phonebook refactoring
- Course Project 3: OOP Clothing Store
- Midterm Project: OOP Microprocessor
- Final Project

## Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- No assignments will be accepted more than 48 hours after the original due date.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instuctor. Such requests must be made at least 24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student. Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.

## Academic Integrity

When you turn in an assignment, you are representing that the work is your own.
Copying work from another student or from online and submitting it is _plagiarism_.

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found 
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action 
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:
- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo

integrity, review the ["What is Plagiarism?" Video](https://youtu.be/2qmWz7Qvh0E)

## Practice Exercises

Each week will include practice exercises to help you better understand
programming. You are _strongly_ encouraged to complete the practice exercises 
each week. They will be graded based on completion, not correctness. Submitting 
any of the practice exercises for a given week will count towards the practice 
exercise grade for the course. You are required to submit ten exercises 
throughout the term.

## Practice Exercise Submission

You are required to submit documentation for 10 practice exercises over the
course of the term. Each one will count for 1/10 of your practice grade, or 1%
of your overall grade.

To log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit a link using this form](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

* Practice exercises will be graded for _completion_ not _correctness_. You have
to document that you did the work, but we won't be checking if you got it right.
* You are welcome to log practice that is not one of the exercises listed on the 
practice page.
* You can submit a link to a github repo, a replit, a Google doc, or some other 
resource.
* Each entry in the form will count for one of your ten required practice entries.

Your entry in the log will count for credit as long as it:
* is accessible to your instructor
* shows your own work
