# Course Projects

During some weeks, you'll be given a project involving the new skills and concepts you
learned. There will be a project for **Subclasses and Error-handling**, **Tests and Refactoring**, and **Abstraction**.

The projects will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will also be a midterm project and a final project, described on the next
pages.
