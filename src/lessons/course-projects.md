# Course Projects

During some weeks, you'll be given a project involving the new skills and concepts you learned.

The projects will be challenging, and it's recommended that you complete the
material and practice problems before you start the project each week.

There will also be a midterm project and a final project.

## Projects List

Below are the projects you'll be working on in this course:

- Course Project 1: OOP Course Manager
- Course Project 2: Phonebook refactoring
- Course Project 3: OOP Clothing Store
- Midterm Project: OOP Microprocessor
- Final Project

## Grading

Your course grade will consist of:

- 10% Exercises
- 40% Course Projects
- 25% Midterm Project
- 25% Final Project

## Exercises

Some weeks will include exercises at the end to help you better understand
programming. You will need to complete exercises, because they will count towards your score in the class.

Exercises make up 10% of the course grade. Exercises (or tasks) will contain assigned points beside them like this:

For the weeks that have exercises, please complete two or more for that week, in order to earn full marks.

After completing each exercise, use the below form to log your practice for credit:

> **[Submit a link using this form](https://forms.gle/UbWLpo86JsWxrpNe9)**

- You are welcome to log work that is not one of the exercises listed on the page.
- You can submit a link to a github repo or a replit. Make sure sure the link is accessible.

Your entry in the log will count for credit as long as it:

- is accessible to your instructor
- shows your own work

## Late Policy

- Late assignments will be accepted up to 48 hours after the original due date, but a **late penalty of 10%** will be applied for _each day_ the assignment is late.

- If a student has a legitimate reason for being unable to submit an assignment on time (e.g. illness, family emergency), they may request an extension by sending an email to the instuctor. Such requests must be made at least 24 hours before the original due date. The instructor will review each request and decide whether to grant an extension on a case-by-case basis.

- If an extension is granted, the new due date will be determined by the instructor and communicated to the student. Late penalties will still apply if the assignment is not submitted by the new due date.

## Academic Integrity

When you turn in an assignment, you are representing that the work is your own.
Copying work from another student or from online and submitting it is _plagiarism_.

As a reminder of Kibo's academic honesty and integrity policy: Any student found
to be committing academic misconduct will be subject to disciplinary action
including dismissal.

Disciplinary action may include:

- Failing the assignment
- Failing the course
- Dismissal from Kibo
