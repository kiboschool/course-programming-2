For the final project, you'll make an app that lets you create an event on the real EventBrite.com website.

EventBrite.com is a website that lists events like music concerts, conferences, and social meetups.

Your program will send requests to an API to create an event. It will also use a local database to store a list of events that have been created. See the project's readme file for more information!
