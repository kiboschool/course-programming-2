For the midterm project, you will write a program that processes numbers (reading through a data file and performing computation).

Your program will send requests to an API to assist with some of the computation.

(This project has a few similarities with the microprocessor simulation project in Programming 1. This time, though, you will be using classes and methods, instead of functions.)
