# Midterm Project

MIDTERM PROJECT: OBJECT-ORIENTED MICROPROCESSOR

This builds on your work from https://github.com/kiboschool/microprocessor-simulation

We haven't posted the description of the midterm project yet, we will post it here.

<!--

* Make a Microprocessor class that has a method runInstruction() and helper methods for implementing the ops
* Get it working so that it can run the prior examples
* Then add a new feature
    * instead of a number can put the special string askForInput to get a number. Enforce valid integer.
    * instead of a number can put the special string result to the refer to previous number computed
    * (this will have to be state on the class)
    * So you could say `{add 4, 5}`, `{add result, 5}`, `{print result}`
    * This way you can make it do real computation
    * We’ll give a little demo ‘program’ to do something like convert celsius to fahrenheit and print answer
* Don’t worry about making any other classes (each operation could be a class (e.g. a base class could parse input into a list that children interpret) but it doesn’t need to be (there will still be an if-then mapping opname to logic, just earlier))
* Benefit of OOP for this:
    * state is confined to one place
    * Could make a child class that logs
    * Could make a child class that measures stats
* Make a child class of the microprocessor that writes the result down into a file each time.
