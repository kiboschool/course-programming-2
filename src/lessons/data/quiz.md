## Dictionaries inside of dictionaries

We can even have a dictionary that contains lists, and a list that contains dictionaries. This type of "nested" structure can actually be a great way to store data. Consider an example like this,

For practice, write a function that gets a list of park names. Remember that if you use a for loop on a dictionary, each time through the loop you will get one of the keys, (in this case a country name).

And if you use a for loop on a list, each time through the loop you will get one element in the list (the element could be a string, dictionary, or another list).
