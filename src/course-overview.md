## Course Description

In this course, you'll build off of what you learned in Programming 1.

- You will use the tools you've learned to build more advanced programs:
programs that read from the internet, display information visually, and
interact with databases.
- You'll deepen our knowledge of software fundamentals - learning about
object-oriented software, how to recover from errors, and how data
is structured.
- Finally, you will begin to explore the philosophy of writing software.
This means going beyond "does my program compute the right thing",
but to ask if a program is well organized, if it will be readable by
other programmers, and if it will it be re-usable in other projects.

By the end of the course, you will understand what objects and classes are
(in other words, writing object-oriented programs),
you will be able to write more advanced programs:
interacting with data sources, using a language called SQL,
and creating graphics to visualize data. You will
also be structuring your code in more-professional ways.
Along the way you'll pick up tips on how to investigate programs that aren't working correctly, and gain experience reading and understanding code that other people have written.

Everything in the course will be valuable for doing real-world work in the field.

You aren't on this journey alone. We will collaborate, and we'll communicate in discord and office hours to help answer questions.

## How the Course Works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Complete practice exercises to learn and internalize the concepts
- Complete assignments and projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.
