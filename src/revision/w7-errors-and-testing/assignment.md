In this project, you won't be writing the solution code -- you'll be writing the tests that check that a solution is correct.

## Submission

In order to get credit for your project, you must:

- push your code to Github Classroom
- submit your work in Gradescope
- submit your project in Woolf

When you have finished the project, take care that your code passes the `test-tests.py` file. This file will be set up with autograding to score your project. (We're using the Gradescope autograding feature, which assigns most of the points automatically based on the unit tests.)
