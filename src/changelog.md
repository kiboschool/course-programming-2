# Week 1 revisions:
## Content:
- Rewrote the intro to the week with the aim of making the high level idea of OOP more relatable
- Made minor edits to **Objects and Methods** to accomodate for not having seen json objects yet. Shifted some content from the **Classes** notes here.
- Added deeper explanations of `__init__` and `self` in the **Classes** notes
- Removed the page dedicated to justifying the use of OOP. It will come back at a later date.
- Created a new example instead of the video demo to emphasize composition.

## Assignment:
-  Designed a bank-account assignment to assess the student's ability to set up a constructor, customize the `__str__` method, and build increasingly more complex methods. More details in the exercises file as well as the repo: https://github.com/kiboschool/programming2-w1-bank-accounts
